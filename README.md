# Omniauth::Shipbob

This is an OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to ShipBob. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-shipbob'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-shipbob

## Usage

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :shipbob,
         'client_id', 'client_secret',
         :callback_url => 'http://example.test/auth/shipbob/callback',
         :scope => 'scopes-list',
         :authorize_params => {:integration_name => 'my-application-name', :response_mode => 'form_post' }
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
